Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd wants to utilize the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions), and see which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.
