# KPMG_Data_Analytics_Case

Sprocket Central Pty Ltd has given us a new list of 1000 potential customers with their demographics and attributes. However, these customers do not have prior transaction history with the organisation. The marketing team at Sprocket Central Pty Ltd wants to utilize the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions), and see which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation.

PROBLEM SOLVING APPROACH
1. Data Transformation and Model development on Python
2. Data Inspection of the new list of 1000 potential customers
3. Model deployment to predict individual profit potential and rank customers by profit 

This notebook includes the process of model development to predict the sum of profit from each customer.
